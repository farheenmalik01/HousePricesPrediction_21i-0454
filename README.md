Since you mentioned not to use Node.js (and consequently not to use `npm`), we will need an alternative way to deploy your Flask application to Vercel.

### Alternative Approach to Deploy Flask to Vercel without Node.js

While Vercel is primarily built around the JavaScript ecosystem, it does support Python projects. The deployment can be managed using Vercel's built-in support for Python. However, instead of using `npm` for the Vercel CLI, we'll directly use Vercel's web interface and integrate it with GitHub for deployment.

### Steps to Deploy Flask to Vercel Without Using Node.js

1. **Ensure Your Project is Set Up Properly**

   Make sure your project has the following structure and required files:

   ```
   flask-ml-vercel/
   ├── app.py
   ├── model.py
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── vercel.json
   ├── templates/
   │   └── index.html
   └── .github/
       └── workflows/
           └── deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Install Git and Push Your Project to GitHub**

   If you haven't already, you need to push your project to a GitHub repository.

   - **Install Git**: [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it.
   - **Initialize Git** in your project directory:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - **Add All Files to Git**:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - **Create a Repository on GitHub** and link it to your local repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

3. **Configure Vercel to Deploy Your Project**

   Instead of using the Vercel CLI (`vercel` command), use the Vercel web interface to deploy your Flask application:

   1. **Sign Up and Log In to Vercel**:
      - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and create an account if you don’t have one.

   2. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**:
      - On the Vercel dashboard, click on **"New Project"**.
      - Select **"Import Git Repository"**.
      - Connect your GitHub account to Vercel and authorize access.

   3. **Import Your Project**:
      - Find your repository (`yourusername/your-repo-name`) and click **"Import"**.

   4. **Configure Project Settings**:
      - Vercel should automatically detect the Python project structure and suggest default settings.
      - Ensure that the **"Build Command"** is `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the **"Output Directory"** is set to `.` (current directory).

   5. **Add Environment Variables (if needed)**:
      - If your application requires any environment variables (e.g., for a database connection or secret keys), add them in the **Environment Variables** section.

   6. **Deploy**:
      - Click **"Deploy"**. Vercel will start the deployment process, which includes installing dependencies and starting your Flask server.

4. **Configure GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment (Optional)**

   Your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` should already be set up to trigger deployments on each push to the `main` branch:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to Vercel

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Setup Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: '3.8'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Since you're deploying through the web interface, this GitHub Actions workflow is optional, but it provides automatic deployment upon each code push.

5. **Access Your Deployed Application**

   Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide a URL to access your Flask application. You can now visit this URL to see your app live.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can deploy a Flask application to Vercel without using Node.js or the Vercel CLI. Instead, you are leveraging Vercel's web interface and GitHub integration for a smooth deployment process.
